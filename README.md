# Kickstarting with Excel
Module 1 An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns Project

## Overview of Project & Purpose
The purpose of this project was to introduce us to different ways of using Excel for analysis of a kickstarter campaign for theatrical plays. The main task was to filter through a data set with thousands of kickstarter campaigns and find data that would be helpful to Louise who is running a campaign for her play *Fever*. Here my analysis shows trends about the outcomes of kickstarter campaigns in the plays subcategory based on launch date and whether or not the goal was achieved.   
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
